2.2 ShoppingBasket
We will create a Smart ShoppingBasket.
The basket registers article id and weight when an item is added.
The basket has a display that shows the total amount and price of its contents.
This price is calculated by an external service, 
as there can be updates at any given moment.
We are required by law to only allow recalculation if the price of an item is lowered.
that returns the amount, name and price of each article in the basket
as there might be new updates at any given moment.
It also has an integrated sound module 
that notifies the user of updates or when the weight is exceeded


Scenario: We add an item to an empty basket
Given we have an empty Shopping Basket
And there is an item in the catalog: articleId: 1, name: "12 Eggs", price: 2.69 Euros 
When we add an item with Article Id 1
Then the Display shows: "1 x 12 Eggs, 2.69 Euro; Total Amount: 2.69 Euro"

Scenario: A lower price update has been pushed
Given we have shopping basket with these contents:
| ArticleId	| Amount	|
| 1			| 2			|
| 2			| 5			|
And the catalog contains these articles:
| ArticleId	| Name		| Price	|
| 1			| 12 Eggs	| 2.69	|
| 2			| 1l Water	| 1.5	|
When there is a price update for articleId: 1 => 2.20 Euros
Then the Display shows: "2 x 12 Eggs, 4.40 Euro; 5 x 1l Water, 7.50 Euro; Total Amount: 11.90 Euro"
And the sound module beeps

Scenario: A higher price update has been pushed
Given we have shopping basket with these contents:
| ArticleId	| Amount	|
| 1			| 2			|
| 2			| 5			|
And the catalog contains these articles:
| ArticleId	| Name		| Price	|
| 1			| 12 Eggs	| 2.69	|
| 2			| 1l Water	| 1.5	|
When there is a price update for articleId: 1 => 3.20 Euros
Then the Display shows: "2 x 12 Eggs, 5.38 Euro; 5 x 1l Water, 7.50 Euro; Total Amount: 12.88 Euro"
And the sound module does not beep

Scenario: The allowed weight is exceeded
Given we have an empty Shopping Basket with allowed weight: 0.75kg
When we add an item with weight 1kg
Then the Display shows: "Allowed weight exceeded, please remove one or more articles."
And the sound module beeps three times
