2.1 Restaurant
We're responsible for writing the software for a restaurant.
In a class Restaurant, we can place and serve orders. 
This class has a dependency on an IKitchen. 
An order has a TableNumber and a TotalPrice.
A table can have multiple orders on one night.
At the end of the night, we want to be able to retrieve statistics for the tables and orders
that have been placed. We want to see this:
- The table with the highest sum of all TotalPrices for that table
- The table with the most orders
- The avarage TotalPrice
The Kitchen can return all placed orders through: GetAllOrders()
Please write code and unit tests for this class
