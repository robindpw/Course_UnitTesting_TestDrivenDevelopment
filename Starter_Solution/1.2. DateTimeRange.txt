1.2. DateTimeRange
    Create a struct DateTimeRange. 
	A DateTimeRange is constructed using two properties: Begin and End.
	DateTimeRanges are not equal if Begin and/or End are not equal.
	DateTimeRange has one method: IsInRange(DateTime dateTime),
	that will determine if the given date time is in its range.

	You can use FluentAssertions and/or Theories. DateTime cannot be passed
	as an argument to InlineData, so you will have to use MemberData
