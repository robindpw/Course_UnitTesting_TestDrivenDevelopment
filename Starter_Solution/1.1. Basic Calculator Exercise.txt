1. Unit Testing Basics
1.1. Create a Calculator class with these methods:
    o Add(int x, int y)
    o Subtract(int x, int y)
    o Multiply(int x, int y)
    o Divide(int x, int y)

1.1.1. Create these tests for Add:
    o 1 + 0 = 1
	o -5 + 10 = 5
	o 0 + 1 = 1
	o Create tests with the same operands as the previous one, but for the other operations

1.1.2 Implement the asserts from the previous tests using the library FluentAssertions

1.1.3 Parametrize the previous unit tests using Theory and InlineData

1.1.4 We've received a bug, write a test for this case:
    2147483647 + 1 = 2147483648
